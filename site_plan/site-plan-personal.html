      <h3>Your Groceries, Your Budget</h3>
      <p>
        Summary: 
          This is an app for those annoying situations where you have a $150 bucks to spend one groceries, and sales tax slips by you.
          The basic functionality will be to allow you to simply subtract prices from a determined budget with salex tax already 
          applied.
        Bells and Whistles:
          Those imputs from the doing your shopping could be remembered. I plan on building a way to build lists based off of previous
          prices of products you have bought before. It could include which stores had what prices and where. I want to give more 
          information for better choices to be made.
