Brainstorm Text for Websites
    Why will people come to your site?
        They will be coming as this is going to be fufilling two differrent roles. It will be first and foremost a place to desribe myself,
        my interests, my skills, and who I am. Going along with that will be child pages for my persional projects that I feel deserve their own 
        pages to describe them.
        The first child page will be about a video game I want to make called 'Fighter Duel'
        The second Child page will be about an app I am making. Its dev name is currently 'Grocery_shopping/List'.
            It is going to be a simple app which does three things
            default, record grocery items into a list alongside a price which will allow them to easily count how much they are spending on 
            groceries
            2, will allow you to make a grocery list for when you go shopping.  
    What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
    What information is necessary to cover the questions your visitors have?
        Who am I, and what have I done.
    Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information?
        Well, this is going to be a personal portfolio site. The only other source of this information is going to be me.
